                <p>Also known as M. K. O. Abiola ( 24 August 1937 - 7 July 1998) was a Nigerian businessman, publisher, and politician. He was the honorary supreme military commander of the Oyo Empire and an aristocrat of the Egba clan.
                    <br>
                    Abiola ran for the presidency in 1993, for which the election results were annulled by then military president Ibrahim Babangida because of allegations that they were corrupt and unfair.[7] Abiola was awarded the National honour Grand Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic (GCFR), an honour awarded to only Nigerian heads of state, posthumously on 6 June 2018, by President Muhammadu Buhari and Nigeria's democracy day was changed to from 29 May to 12 June in his honour.

                <p>Abiola was a personal friend of Ibrahim Babangida[11] and he is believed to have supported Babangida's coming to power.
                    Abiola's support in the June 1993 presidential election cut across all geo-political zones and religious divisions. He was among a few politicians to accomplish such influence during his time.[13] By the time of his death, he had become an unexpected symbol of democracy.
